Prevent composer-managed WordPress objects being changed through the web
interface.

== Description ==

If you're using composer to manage WordPress core, plugins, and themes, the
last thing you want is for a user to install, edit, or update objects through
the web interface. This simple plugin removes that access on activation, and
restores default access on deactivation.

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.0 =
* Initial release.
